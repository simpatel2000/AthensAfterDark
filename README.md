# Final Project

Notes about Github for team:

## Installation

Find the ssh key under the green "code" button and copy it.

```bash
git clone "insert ssh code here (remove quotes)"
```

## Working in Github

If you've created a new file, use 
```bash
git add file/path/here
```
When all new files are added, use 
```bash
git commit -am "write commit message"
```
When ready to push to the master, use 
```bash
git push origin main
```

NOTE: We *can* use different branches if we want, but using one branch is the easiest. However, this means we will *always have to communicate* if we are working on files, to avoid push and pull issues.
